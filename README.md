# Project_Mgmt

Tools and utilities for managing group projects.

Each group will be created as a team on the COGS108 organization, and given a private group repo to work on. Membership is set up so that this provides access only to their own group repo (not to any other groups, or to our private repos). Instructors (as owners) have full access to all the repos - so to all the groups repos. 

The current set-up plan is to create repos, adding the group members, with a generic README, and a copy of their project proposal. 

## Setup Instructions
1-Download all Proposals

2-Extract all project group memberships

3-Create teams on COGS108 of project groups
    Creating teams will invite students to join COGS108 as Members

4-Create repos, adding each team, their proposal, and a generic README
