## Files used for managing projects in COGS 108

File Descriptions:

- `create_repos.ipynb` - generates private repos for COGS 108 groups; gives students write access; adds instructional staff to all repos
- `Repos.Rmd` - accomplishes way too many things and needs to be updated
  - for use to create a file that will be used throughout the quarter to map group-level grades to individuals
  - checks if students have submitted their groups correctly and to identify students who have not signed up for a group.
  - assigns previou projects for groups to review
  - after `create_repos.ipynb`, adds templates to each group's repository
  - generates some plots to show how close group's "grades" were to what grades were actually earned
- `add_feedback.ipynb` - adds feedback as issue to each group's private repo for proposal, checkpoints, and final report/video
- `projecess_finalproj.R` - to clone all final project notebooks and include in a single repo at the end of the quarter (only includes groups who opt-in to sharing publicly)

- `ProjectGrading/` - contains notebooks used each quarter to check for agreement across graders
